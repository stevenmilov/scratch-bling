## Notes
I know this does not utilitize PostgreSQL or AWS, and I apologize for this. This is because I did not have enough time to figure out all of the errors for those tools/environments. I did not want to hand in a broken program, so I scratched it and did as much as I could given the knowledge I acquired from my education and own research. This utilizes Flask (without RESTful API due to errors I could not solve in the alloted time), Bootstrap, and SQLAlchemy. I would work on this more, however I am going away for the weekend and do not have more time. This took me 8 hours. I worked on PostgreSQL,and converting this database into SQLAlchemy, however I did not have enough time to finish this, so after hour 3, I scratched it and created this Flask application to showcase what I currently have the ability to do. In turn, this Flask application took me 5 hours. In order to complete this project and learn all the frameworks that I was not introduced to, I would need at least 15 hours and I did not have that much time unfortunately. I hope I can make it up to you by learning these tools over the summer in July.
